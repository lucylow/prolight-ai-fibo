# From Studio Lighting to FIBO JSON

We created a mapping between photography concepts (key, fill, rim, softness, kelvin) and FIBO's structured JSON. This post documents the schema, tips for capture, and sample recipes.

## The Mapping

Here's an example of how we map professional lighting concepts to FIBO JSON:

```json
{
  "lighting": {
    "main_light": { 
      "intensity": 1.0, 
      "color_temperature": 5600, 
      "softness": 0.25 
    },
    "fill_light": {
      "intensity": 0.3,
      "color_temperature": 5600,
      "softness": 0.5
    },
    "rim_light": {
      "intensity": 0.8,
      "color_temperature": 3200,
      "softness": 0.1
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Concepts

### Intensity
Controls the brightness of each light source, typically ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.

### Color Temperature
Measured in Kelvin, this controls the warmth or coolness of the light. Lower values (e.g., 3200K) are warmer, while higher values (e.g., 5600K) are cooler.

### Softness
Determines how hard or soft the light appears. Lower values create harder shadows, while higher values create softer, more diffused light.

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Main Light**: Set your main light intensity first, typically between 0.7 and 1.0
2. **Balance Fill Light**: Use fill light at 20-40% of main light intensity to reduce harsh shadows
3. **Add Rim Light**: Rim lights add separation and depth, typically at 60-80% intensity
4. **Consider Color Temperature**: Match color temperatures to your scene's mood and time of day

## Conclusion

This structured approach to lighting gives creative teams the control they need while maintaining the flexibility of AI generation.
