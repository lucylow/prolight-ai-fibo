# Why Deterministic AI Matters for Creative Teams

ProLight AI maps professional lighting to structured JSON so that the **same recipe yields identical outputs**. This reduces iteration waste and aligns AI workflows with production requirements.

> Example: same `seed` + `.pljson` file → identical pixels across runs.

## The Problem with Randomness

Traditional AI image generation relies heavily on randomness. While this can produce creative variations, it breaks production workflows where consistency is critical.

## The Solution

By mapping lighting parameters to structured JSON, ProLight AI ensures that:

- **Reproducibility**: Same inputs produce same outputs
- **Version Control**: Track changes to lighting setups
- **Batch Processing**: Apply consistent lighting across multiple images
- **Professional Workflows**: Integrate with existing production pipelines

## Real-World Impact

Creative teams can now:

1. Iterate on lighting without losing previous results
2. Share lighting presets across team members
3. Maintain consistency across campaigns
4. Reduce time spent on manual adjustments
